CODING-MODE 
    - SERVER-SIDE
        - when you close the coding session, the program is deleted

    - enable basic keys (with ncurses):
        - if I enter up arrow, the previous command shows
        - if I enter down arrow, the successive command shows
        - if I enter left arrow, move cursor to the left
        - if I enter right arrow, move cursor to the right
